	 *     confirmButton.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(1, 0, 0)
	 *     confirmButton.Text = "Close?"
	 *     confirmButton.Parent = pluginGui
	 * 
	 *     -- listen for click
	 *     confirmButton.Activated:Connect(function()
	 *         -- close the gui
	 *         pluginGui.Enabled = false
	 *     
	 *         -- remove confirm button
	 *         confirmButton:Destroy()
	 *     end)
	 * end)

	 * -----------------

	 * 
	 * When \`Workspace/PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled\` is set to false, the contact points are color coded as listed below.

	 * Contact point that has been active for at least 4 frames.
	 * 
	 * Second Pass Contact
	 * 
	 * Contact point that was made by a kernel joint going through a second pass. Rarely seen.
	 * 
	 * Real Time Contact
	 * 
	 * Contact point that was made with a real-time physics body. This applies to tripped \`Humanoid\`.
	 * 
	 * Joint Contact
	 * 
	 * Contact point that was made under the context of a physically simulated joint. This applies to Motors and Hinges.
	 * 
	 * ### PGS Physics Solver
	 * 
	 * When \`Workspace/PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled\` is set to true, the contact points are always colored **RED**, and the length of the arrow will always be 1 stud.  
	 * There are no special conditions tracked, because the PGS solver does not keep specific lookup tables for the states listed in the Spring Solver.

/** A PluginToolbar is an object created by using the [Plugin:CreateToolbar](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Plugin/CreateToolbar) method.

In general, it is good practice for a plugin to use **one and only one** uniquely named toolbar for all of its buttons. In Roblox Studio, toolbars are rendered under the Plugins tab.

 * 
 * Example
 * -------
 * 
 * The following code sample creates a basic toolbar with one button. It should be run as a Roblox Studio plugin, and not run as a [Script](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Script).

It allows the user to initiate a single, one-off action in Roblox Studio through the [Click](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/PluginToolbarButton/Click) event. Pictured below are three PluginToolbarButtons. From left to right: the default, hover and pressed states. The hovered button in the center shows tooltip text, which is the 2nd argument passed to [PluginToolbar:CreateButton](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/PluginToolbar/CreateButton).
 * 
 * ![Three PluginToolbarButtons rendered on a PluginToolbar titled "Three Wise Monkeys"](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt3d234c03ebdc6750/PluginToolbarButton-light.png)
 * 
 * Behavior
 * --------
 * 
 * When pressed, the [Click](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/PluginToolbarButton/Click) event fires. A button will also remain in the pressed state, which may be set manually using [SetActive](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/PluginToolbarButton/SetActive). Upon plugin activation ([Plugin:Activate](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Plugin/Activate)), buttons in all other [PluginToolbar](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PluginToolbar)s will be toggled off. If all buttons in a toolbar are off, the toolbar's plugin is deactivated ([Plugin:Deactivate](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/Plugin/Deactivate)).
 * 
 * When the game viewport is not visible, buttons will be disabled as if their [Enabled](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/PluginToolbarButton/Enabled) property were false. Disabled buttons are desaturated and do not respond to user clicks. By setting [ClickableWhenViewportHidden](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/PluginToolbarButton/ClickableWhenViewportHidden) to true, you can allow plugin buttons to remain clickable (such as during script editing).
 * 
 * History
 * -------
 * 
 * *   Prior to an update released in January 2019, this class was simply known as “Button”. This was changed to reduce confusion with similarly named in-game UI element classes, such as [TextButton](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/TextButton).
